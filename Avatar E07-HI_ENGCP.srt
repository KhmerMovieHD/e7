00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,500
She's just a girl.

162
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,750
[Sokka] She's a princess
and a spiritual leader.

163
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,042
She probably sleeps on a throne
and only eats dewdrops and sunshine.

164
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,875
No way.

165
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,000
Stewed sea prunes. My favorite.

166
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,042
Is it good? What's it taste like?

167
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,333
Like…

168
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,500
like home.

169
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Katara?

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,042
I just wanna say thanks
for helping me get here.

171
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,208
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

172
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,500
A world I wouldn't have seen
if it wasn't for you.

173
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,167
So enjoying the food, are we?

174
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,750
It's delicious.

175
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,083
You say you were entirely self-taught.

176
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:19,292
Yes, I feel like I've come pretty far,
but I still have so much to learn.

177
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,958
That's why I couldn't wait to get here
to meet other Waterbenders

178
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,333
and especially esteemed masters like you.

179
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,583
It must've been difficult
to grow up cut off from other benders.

180
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,833
The Fire Nation's attacks
took so much from you.

181
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,000
From all of us.

182
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,292
The worst part was I…
I couldn't do anything about it.

183
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,417
What's important is you survived.

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,708
That is what we do.

185
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,625
Water is the element of change.

186
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,458
And we Waterbenders
have always adapted to the flow of life.

187
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,292
Tomorrow morning, go and find Yagoda.

188
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,292
She is one of our finest instructors,
and she can start you on your journey.

189
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,458
Thank you, Master Pakku.

It's delicious.

202
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:21,667
When I was a kid, I used to hide out here
when my dad would meet with the elders.

203
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,042
He said he wanted me to see
how things worked in the tribe

204
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,750
because, someday,
it would be my responsibility.

205
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,750
Not very fun.

206
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:34,125
Hmm, so I'd hide out here with the grans
and make dessert.

Did you think I wasn't a girl?

209
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,833
No, no, no. I just figured
with you being a princess and all...

210
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,667
- That I was stuck up?
- Yeah. I mean, no.

211
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,500
I mean, that's what I thought,
but, no, you're ordinary.

212
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,792
Not ordinary,
because that wouldn't be good,

213
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,875
and I think
I should stop saying words now.

214
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,583
[Yue chuckles] I get it.

I know out there I seem all…

but that's what they expect me to be.

217
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't get me wrong.
I love serving my community,

218
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,917
but every now and then,
I just have to go somewhere and…

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000

You know, back home,
it was my duty to protect the village.

223
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,208
I took that seriously.

224

Katara would probably say too seriously,
but the thing was...

I'd love to talk to our brother
from the South. Some combat advice.

Me? You wanna ask me about fighting?

00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:05,917
You have something none of us have.

Tell me, Fire Nation armor. Is it metal?

253
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,252
The reference we have
has spikes on the shoulders.

254

Uh, no metal. Leather.

255
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,750
And, uh, they don't have
shoulder spikes anymore.

256
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,708
The rest of the platoon should hear this.
Would you mind coming to talk to them?

Tell me, Avatar Aang,

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
what do you think is the best approach
to the coming battle?

261
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,167
Might I suggest
you lead the offensive front?

262
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,250
You could spearhead an attack...

263
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,792
Actually, airbending is primarily
a defensive discipline.

264
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,208
Our style is to evade and avoid conflict.

265

But you're not just an Airbender.

You're the Avatar.

Truth is, I haven't mastered
any other bending.

it was still being practiced.

Oh, yes, it's a vital part of our culture.

Would you like to try it?

Feel the flow of energy through the body.

Connect that flow
to the energy in yourself.

Healing…

291
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,208
is more than a physical process.

292
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,083
It's about empathy.

293
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:40,417
You must understand
what it means to feel pain.

294

Then take that pain away.

Excuse me?

302
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,792
I think my basic forms are pretty good,
but I could use help

303

with accuracy and increasing power.

00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,375
I'm sorry, but women don't fight.

We use our skills to heal, not to harm.

306

I don't want to just heal.

It's just that… I think
my skills lie more in combat.

So if it's okay, I'd like to train
in fighting techniques.

We've trained them as best we can,

322
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,250
but none of them know
what we're about to face.

323
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,250
None of them have seen real battle.

324
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,000
Hey, I'm sure they'll do great.

325
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,083
Especially with you leading them.

326
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,375
So…

327
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,375
Princess Yue.

328
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:16,917
She seems great.

329
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,375
Yue, she's dedicated, kind, generous.

330
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,625
She represents the highest ideals
of our tribe. She is the best of us.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You like her.

332
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,708
[Hahn] Um…

333
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,708
The princess and I,

334
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,125
we were betrothed.

335
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,375
It was arranged by our parents when we
were children, but when she turned 16,

336
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,250
she broke it off,

337
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,292
which is her prerogative.

338
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
Wow.

339
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,292
But she never gave a reason why.

340
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,542
So

341
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,569
You would've gone through with it?

342
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,167
You would've married her?

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,792
Thank you for coming
to pay your respects to Avatar Kuruk.

344
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,667
I'm here to do
a little bit more than that.

345
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,750
I'm hoping Kuruk can help me
make a difference in this fight.

346
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,417
Is that a problem?

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's just been a long time
since anyone went to Kuruk for anything.

348
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,042
The truth is,
his memory has faded for most.

349
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,250
During his time as the Avatar,
Kuruk didn't engage much with the world.

350
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
Some say he became enamored
with the Spirit World

351
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,292
and spent most of his time there.

352
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,083
Unfortunately, that meant
he wasn't around much

353
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,583
to help us deal with our problems.

354
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,333
So he didn't do his job as the Avatar.

355
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,208
He let everyone down.

356
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,583
I believe there must be more to his story.

357
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,125
I hope you're right because I need help,

358
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:59,000
and he's the only one who could
possibly understand my situation.

Hello, Aang.

363
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,792
I see you made it to the North.

364
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,792
Yes, because
the Northern Water Tribe's in danger.

365
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,583
Avatar Kyoshi showed me a vision

366
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,167
of Agna Qel'a being destroyed
by the Fire Nation.

367
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,167
I need to stop that from happening.

368
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,458
You can't.

369
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,250
If she showed you
the North being destroyed,

370
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:54,000
then it will happen.

371
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,958
But the battle's outcome
is still uncertain.

372
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,833
Whether the Fire Nation prevails,

373
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,042
whether the Waterbenders survive,

374
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,958
all of that is up to you.

375
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,708
I'm just one kid.

376
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,208
No, you are the Avatar.

377
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,833
When I was at Kyoshi Island,

378
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:14,333
Avatar Kyoshi helped me unleash
these incredible energies.

379
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,583
The Avatar State.

380
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,625
Yes! She said it gave me the strength
of a thousand benders.

381
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,375
I can use that power to save the North.

382
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,500
But to gain control over it,

383
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,000
you need to first
master the other disciplines.

384
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,667
Except she was able to take control.

385
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,417
She could channel the power
through my body.

386
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,042
She was in control. You can do that.

387
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,375
That's not possible.

388
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,000
- Yes, it is. Kyoshi did it.
- I'm not Kyoshi.

- But you still could!
- No, I can't!

[wind howls]

391
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,458
After I became the Avatar,

392
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:52,208
I discovered
dark spirits were on the verge

393
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:55,500
of crossing over into our realm
from the Spirit World.

394
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,708
I had to stop them,

395
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,833
so I spent my life fighting them.

396
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,250
The war I waged on the spirits

397
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,958
damaged my body and corrupted my soul.

398
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,417
In my condition,

399
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,083
I wouldn't be able
to control the Avatar State

400
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,833
any more than you could.

401
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,167
And despite all my sacrifices,

402
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,875
I still couldn't save the one
that mattered the most.

403
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,917
A predatory spirit came
to seek vengeance on me.

404
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,500
Ummi, my beloved,

405
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,333
paid the ultimate price.

406
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,333
<i>The spirit stole her face.</i>

407

- Koh.
- [Kuruk] Listen to me, Aang.

408
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,500
The Avatar must walk alone,

409
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,667
or else the ones you love will suffer.

410
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,625
Oh, sorry. I was looking for Katara.

411
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,208
Oh.

412
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,000
I should get going.

413
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,042
Is something wrong?

414
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,417
No, I'm just

415
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,625
a little tired.

416
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:16,708
Mm. I guess you need to go
and "recombobulate."

417
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,833
I knew it! It was you!

418

- [Yue] Yes.
- You're the fox!

419
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,667
Yes.

420
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,917
But how?

421
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:37,333
Not long after I was born,
I got very sick,

422
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:41,292
so my father pleaded with the spirits
to save my life,

423
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,708
and… a miracle happened.

424
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,792
The Moon Spirit answered his prayer

425
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:51,542
and imbued me with some of its essence
and restored my life.

426
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,458
That's the night my hair changed color.

427
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:58,917
So you're a spirit?

428
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,875
Part spirit, mostly human.

429
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:05,333
Being of both worlds has meant
that I can be a bridge between the two.

430
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,292
That's why I became a priestess,

431
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,208
is to help people connect
with their spirituality.

432
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,583
It also means I have the ability
to visit the Spirit World

433
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,250
in my dreams.

434
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,375
So you pop over there just for fun?

435
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,542
Wouldn't you?

00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,792
It's magical.

437
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,583
Not quite the word I would use.

438
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:23,792
You didn't like it?

439
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,667
What's not to like?

440
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,167
Nearly being mauled by a spirit monster

441
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,208
or getting my face eaten by a predator
or reliving the most painful memories...

442
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,333
Painful?

443
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
It was nothing.

444
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Never mind.

445
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't do that.

446
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,750
Don't make it less than what it is.

447
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,583
It was something that happened
when I was a kid.

448
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:54,583
I overheard my dad saying
he was disappointed in me.

449
00:26:56,042 --> 00:26:58,208
That I wasn't cut out to be a warrior.

450
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,375
That he didn't believe in me.

Do you know what I remember about you
from the Spirit World?

452
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:12,208
You were worried about your friends.

453
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:15,083
You knew they were in trouble,
and you had to help them.

That's what sets you apart.

That's what makes you a warrior.

saw you now, he would agree.

Why did you turn down Hahn?

460
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,958
Hahn is wonderful.

461
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,375
He is everything that a girl could want.

00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:51,833
Was he able to help?

484
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,708
No, he couldn't help me.

485
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,042
I'm on my own.

486
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:04,500
Ah, Katara, how was your time with Yagoda?

487
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,375
[Katara] Great, but I wanted to ask.

488
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,792
Where will I be stationed
during the battle?

489
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,417
Women aren't allowed in combat.
I thought you knew.

490
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,417
No, I didn't.
I wouldn't have accepted it if I did.

491
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,917
It's not a matter of accepting anything.
It's how things are done.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,625
It's stupid, and it's wrong.

493
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,292
This is not up for debate.

494
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,125
I've been fighting Firebenders
ever since I left home.

495
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,542
Can any of your men say that?

496
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,625
- Doesn't matter.
- Why not?

497
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,583
This isn't about them. It's about you.

498
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:35,333
You're not strong enough.
Women aren't strong enough.

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,292
You haven't been training and preparing
to lay down your life for everyone here.

500
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:46,208
And I'm not going to let what happened
to the Southern Tribe happen here.

501
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,583
[somber music playing]

502
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,417
[Katara] They won't let me fight.

503
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,667
They've been stuck behind this wall
for so long,

504
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,917
they've become frozen in time.

505
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
[sighs]

506
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,625
Maybe we should talk to Yue.

507
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,250
- Or maybe...
- Maybe we should listen to them.

508
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,417
Maybe it's better if you didn't fight.

509
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,792
This battle, it'll be like
nothing we've ever faced before.

510
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,917
People are gonna get hurt and die.

511
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,875
I can't lose you and Sokka.

512
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,125
Aang, you're not gonna lose us.

513
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,500
[Aang] But just the thought I could
is gonna hold me back.

514
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,667
These people need the Avatar.

515
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,167
And I can't be the Avatar with you around.

516
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,708
[dramatic music playing]

517
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,500
[Zhao] I wonder what they'll call me
when the news reaches Capital City.

518
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:16,833
I quite like "Zhao the Conqueror."
It should have some flair.

519
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,833
Admiral, if I understand
these battle plans,

520
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,417
you are attempting
a frontal assault on Agna Qel'a.

521
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,417
The city is surrounded
by impassable barriers on three sides.

522
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,833
Its front is protected by an ice wall.

523
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,875
What makes you think you can succeed
when so many others have failed?

524
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:37,417
Because I have something
none of the others had.

525
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:41,042
I have destiny on my side.

526
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,750
Despite what our propaganda
would have you believe,

527
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,042
the Waterbenders are neither weak
nor cowardly.

528
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:52,167
Underestimating them
will lead to tragic consequences.

529
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,250
[Zhao] That won't happen.

530
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:57,792
For one thing, the fleet has been
outfitted with new, deadlier weapons,

531
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,792
but… more importantly…

532
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,625
I have personally made arrangements

533
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,167
to ensure our victory.

534
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,458
What is that?

535
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,375
This…

536
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,625
this is destiny.

537
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,333
He's attacking the fortress head-on,
like a bull in heat.

538
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,750
There may be more,
but he's keeping it to himself.

539
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,833
[suspenseful music playing]

540
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,542
I fear I've underestimated Zhao.
He's more dangerous than I thought.

541
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,625
Yeah, I figured that out

542
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,250
as I was swimming away
from the burning wreck of my boat.

543
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,208
We've almost reached the North.
Have you got a plan yet?

544
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,500
A plan?

545
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,375
The plan is to prove
my father wasn't wrong

546
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,083
to trust me with this mission.

547
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:47,750
The plan is to go in
and capture the Avatar once and for all.

548
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,250
The plan is to reclaim
what's rightfully mine!

549
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,500
So no plan?

550
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,292
I'm working on it, Uncle.

551

[sighs]

552
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,375
I'm still surprised by Zhao's boldness.

553
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,292
I'd have thought it beyond him.

554
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:06,458
It's almost as if
he's working with someone else.

who has to deal with that.

642
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,000
That's what it means to be a family.

643
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,292
Kuruk, Roku, Kyoshi.

644
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,458
They all said
that I need to do this by myself.

645
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,500
The Avatar must bear the burden alone.

646
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,750
This is the past.

647
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,167
Now, only one person
can tell you the future.

648
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,750
The person who'll write
<i>The Legend of Aang</i>.

649
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,792
She means you. You got that, right?

Soot.

654
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,792
The Fire Nation's here.

655
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,125
Okay.

656
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,750
Time to fight.
